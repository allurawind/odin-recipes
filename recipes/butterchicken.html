    <h2>A classic Indian Butter Chicken recipe!</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken is a type of curry made from chicken and a spiced tomato and butter sauce.
         It's also known as murgh makhani. The dish originated in Delhi and is similar to chicken tikka masala.</p>
        <p>It originated in northern India, in Amritsar, to be exact.
         Legend has it that chefs there made chicken tikka with heavy amounts of butter to stay true to their Punjabi roots.
          But they didn't stop there: They added more butter as a garnish and called it butter chicken (or murgh makhani).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup crushed buttery round cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>Place cracker crumbs and eggs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken.</li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
