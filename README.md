# odin-recipes
This project contains recipes about various cuisines that you can replicate at home!

After I'm done completing this project, it would demonstrated my ability to:
1. use git and the command line to make repos and work with files and modify them
2. use the knowledge I've learned on basic HTML syntax and formatting from The Odin Project
3. google and solve problems effectively
4. and lastly, be able to make a functioning and usable website as the endgoal
